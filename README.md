# Math-Series Lab 02

**Author**: Connor Boyce
**Version**: 1.0.1 - First itereation of the assignment.

## Overview
This code base is using the rules of lucas and fibonacci in order to bring out an expected input represetned by n and producing the correct output that has been placed in the testing module. 

## Getting Started
1. Utilized resources online to understand what the fibonacci numbering system was first off.
2. Ended up making functions for both fibonacci and lucas that would correpsond with tests.
3. Finally, implemented tests and ran testing to make sure that the fucntions pased.

## Architecture
In this I used Python, poetry shell, and pytest.

## Change Log
Made changes to put in functions like the fibonacci and lucas function. Made tests in the math_series.py testing area to see if functions passed or not. Current test all have passed.

## Credit and Collaborations
Had help from the following: Alex Payne, Brandon and Eddie. Alos used the following link to understand Fibonacci rule better: [Python Recursion for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3VQmxoWLHY)

Name of feature:
Estimate of time needed to complete: 2-3 hours.

Start time: 12/07/21 7:45pm

Finish time: 12/08/21 9:10pm

Actual time needed to complete: took me about 2.5 hours in total to complete the lab and do testing.
